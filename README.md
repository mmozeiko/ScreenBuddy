Screen Buddy
============

Simple application for remote desktop control over internet for Windows 10 and 11.

Get latest binary here: [ScreenBuddy.exe][]

**WARNING**: Windows Defender or other AV software might report false positive detection

Features:
 * privacy friendly - no accounts, no registration, no telemetry
 * simple to use - no network configuration needed, works across NAT's
 * secure - all data in transit is end-to-end encrypted
 * efficient - uses GPU accelerated video encoder & decoder for minimal CPU usage
 * lightweight - native code application, uses very small amount of memory
 * small - zero external dependencies, only default Windows libraries are used
 * integrated file transfer - upload file to remote computer who shares the screen

Building
========

To build the binary from source code, have [Visual Studio][VS] installed, and simply run `build.cmd`.

Technical Details
=================

If you want to read source code, you can find there & learn about following things:

 * Doing simple win32 UI with dialog API and basic interactions with window controls
 * Using [Media Foundation][] for hardware accelarated H264 video encoding and decoding
 * Using [Video Processor MFT] to convert RGB texture to NV12 for encoding, and back from decoding
 * Using asynchronous Media Foundation transform events for video encoding to keep code simple & running on main thread
 * Capturing screen to D3D11 texture, using code from [wcap][]
 * Simple D3D11 shader to render texture, optionally scaling it down by preserving aspect ratio
 * Using [DerpNet][] library for network communication via Tailscale relays
 * Using [WinHTTP][] for https requests to gather inital info about Tailscale relay regions
 * Parsing JSON with [Windows.Data.Json][] API, using code from [TwitchNotify][]
 * Copying & pasting text from/to clipboard
 * Simple progress dialog using Windows [TaskDialog][] common control
 * Basic drag & drop to handle files dropped on window, using [DragAcceptFiles][] function

TODOs
=====

Missing features and/or future improvements:

 - [ ] Sending keyboard input, currently only mouse input is supported
 - [ ] Optionally hide local mouse cursor, will require receiving how cursor changes from remote computer
 - [ ] Better network code, use non-blocking DNS resolving, connection & send calls
 - [ ] Improved encoding, adjust bitrate based on how fast network sends are going through
 - [ ] Better error handling, currently many situations may show very simple disconnection message without any details
 - [ ] Integrate wcap improved color conversion code for better image quality 
 - [ ] More polished UI, allow choosing options - bitrate, framerate, which monitor to share, or share only single window
 - [ ] Clean up the code and comment how things work, currently it is a very rushed and hacky 1-day job
 - [ ] Performance & memory optimizations, in many places can preallocate API resources and skip various API calls
 - [ ] File transfer to both directions
 - [ ] Caputure, encode and send to remote view also the audio output
